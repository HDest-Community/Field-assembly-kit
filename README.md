### Notes
---
- Weapon upgrade kits can only be found in backpacks. They are also sold by the [Merchant](https://gitlab.com/accensi/hd-addons/merchant) if you have that loaded.
- Loadout code is `wuk`.
- Orange upgrade means it can be downgraded if installed.
- Minor upgrades cost a single upgrade point. For the moment this is only the case with downgradeable items. Exceptions exist, such as the bullpup conversion, which costs a full kit.
