### Notes
---
- Weapon upgrade kits can only be found in backpacks. They are also sold by the [Merchant](https://gitlab.com/accensi/hd-addons/merchant) if you have that loaded.
- Loadout code is `wuk`.
- Orange items mean it's a feature rather than an actual upgrade (at least in general; exceptions may exist). These items can be downgraded if installed.
- You do not get points back from downgrading weapons.
